# open-uptown-website

This website was built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) as a proof of concept.

## Instructions

Follow these steps to run it locally or go to [this temporaly url](https://edgargigaramirez.github.io/) to check it out.

1. Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) environment.
2. Edit `Gemfile` file and comment out the following line since this is required only for *GitHub Pages*:
> gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
3. Then:
```bash
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll build
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Caveats

For the purpose of this proof of concept this Jekill project is based on the example from Jekyll Documentation and its theme copied from [Lagrange a minimalist Jekyll theme](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Lagrange#github-pages-installation) just to hear feedback from this first draft.

Please leave comments and feedback.

Enjoy!
